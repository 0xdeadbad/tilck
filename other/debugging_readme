In order to allow Tilck's gdb script to work, add the following line in your
gdbinit file (typically ~/.gdbinit):

   add-auto-load-safe-path <ABSOLUTE-PATH-OF-TILCK-BUILD-DIRECTORY>

This is required because GDB's security protection. Without it, you'll see
GDB complaining like:

Reading symbols from ./build/tilck_unstripped...
warning: File "/home/vlad/dev/tilck/build/tilck_unstripped-gdb.py" auto-loading has been declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
To enable execution of this file add
	add-auto-load-safe-path /home/vlad/dev/tilck/build/tilck_unstripped-gdb.py
line to your configuration file "/home/vlad/.gdbinit".
To completely disable this security protection add
	set auto-load safe-path /
line to your configuration file "/home/vlad/.gdbinit".
For more information about this security protection see the
"Auto-loading safe path" section in the GDB manual.  E.g., run from the shell:
	info "(gdb)Auto-loading safe path"
