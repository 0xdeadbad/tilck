Please check the [contributing] document and in particular the section
"Commit style & pull requests" before sending out the pull request.
Choose between model 1 or model 2 for the commits. **Hint:** for most
people, model 1 is right choice. Model 2 is great for people
who have time & patience and want to use the Linux kernel contribution style.
