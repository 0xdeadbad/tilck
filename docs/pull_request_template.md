Thank you for contributing to the project!

In order to ensure a fast and smooth review process:

- Please **read carefully** the [contributing] document before sending out
  the pull request, to make sure the changes follow project's **coding style**
  and meet the acceptance criteria (e.g. don't break builds, tests etc.)

- Lines in any source file must be no more than **80** columns long,
  **no exceptions**. Run the `scripts/dev/count_lines_of_code -l`
  script to check for long lines in your branch.

- For the commits, choose between model 1 or model 2. **Hint:** for most people,
  model 1 is the right choice as it's simpler and more time-efficient for
  contributors. Model 2 is great for people who have time & patience and want
  to use the Linux kernel contribution style.
